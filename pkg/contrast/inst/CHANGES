An error check was added for lme models that will fail if the covariance 
matrix of the variance-covariance coefficients has issues (since lme() 
counts the number of random effects when calculating degrees of freedom).

With lme(), this problem is signaled by lmeObject$apVar being a character 
string (eg. "Non-positive definite approximate variance-covariance")
